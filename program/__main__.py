# Make the timeframes starting time exactly as they appear in the header
# Use a time scale separately of the xarray
# What happens when a square root channel is provided??? --> make a filter in scc_converter

#Quicklook --> 2 time scales (timeframes or file number) - be able to trim time dimension as argument
#Automate pretrigger bin flagging --> sequential removal of outliers
# Automate background calculations when a pretrigger does not exists
# The Q-switch trigger lasts 20Î¼s --> average the dark above!
# Dark subtraction, doing it in the rangecorrected signal maybe adds some noise but probably it's ok
# Heymann check noise paper!
